the code files in this repository were used for the publication "A stochastic compartmental model to simulate interspecies influenza transmission in an indoor hog grower unit"

Control Measures have their own R scripts. Baseline models were created from using the Vaccination R file, but setting the hog vaccine efficacy to 0. 
We tested a variety of beta transmssion parameters from the literature. For the manuscript we only presented results when the beta transmissoin parameter was calculated using an Ro of 10.
This value was chosen from experimental data from Romagosa et al when studying pH1N1 in pigs.
